      Ultra photorealistic RAW 8K photo of an attractive 30-year-old woman, 
      commanding presence, seated in an antique velvet armchair within a dimly lit,

      tailored dark power suit, adorned with minimalist, high-end gold jewelry. 
      Her expression is one of quiet supremacy and astute intelligence. Low-angle 
      shot, focusing from her designer heels slowly ascending to her piercing gaze.
